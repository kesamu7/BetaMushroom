Mushroom tracking.

This application is going to assist people that like to hunt for wild mushrooms. The project allows users to record the quantity and type of
mushrooms that they have collected on a hunting trip. They can also add an image if they would like. I will also add the ability to
write some notes about the hunt that the user went on, this will be available each time the user submits a record into his collection of 
mushrooms. 

Users will create a profile. They will be able to search for other users profiles and see their collection if the user has a public profile.
